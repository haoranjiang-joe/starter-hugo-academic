abstract: With the advancement of technology, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can be applied to complex tunnel networks in long tunnel construction to enhance vehicle operation safety and efficiency. This paper proposes an optimization method for CAVs' operation in long tunnel constructions. Firstly, a spatiotemporal coordinated optimization model with decentralized time and hierarchical networks is proposed to minimize the total working time for completing transportation services. The model integrates macro task allocation and micro node control and optimizes the vehicle-space-time relationships of CAVs to prevent conflicts and collisions. Secondly, a heuristic algorithm named Search-Adjustment Genetic Algorithm (SAGA) is developed to solve the problem considering the model's complexity and engineering characteristics. Thirdly, numerical experiments are designed to validate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm. The results indicate that (1) the proposed model can effectively deconflict CAVs in the road network to ensure safety and obtain a low total working time to fulfill the transportation demand. (2) Compared to the commercial solver Gurobi, the proposed algorithm demonstrates significantly superior solution accuracy and efficiency within an acceptable time limit. (3) The solution ensures the safety and efficiency of CAVs and increases their utilization compared with engineering-oriented methods, resulting in a 50% reduction in CAV acquisition costs, a 29% and 85% reduction in running time and delay respectively, and a reduction in fuel consumption. (4) As the number of transportation services and the complexity of the road network increases, the efficiency gains become more prominent and better adapted to the needs of the actual long tunnel construction project. To sum up, the proposed model and algorithm can ensure the safety and efficiency of providing transportation services in future long tunnel construction. Moreover, it can be adapted for controlling CAVs in road networks such as other construction scenarios and urban road networks.
