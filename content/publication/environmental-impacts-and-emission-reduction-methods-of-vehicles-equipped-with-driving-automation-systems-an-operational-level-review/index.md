abstract: "Driving automation systems offer both opportunities and challenges in
  addressing environmental issues. It is essential to clarify: (1) the
  environmental impacts of driving automation systems-equipped vehicles
  (referred to as automated vehicles, i.e., AVs in this review) and (2) the
  methods for leveraging AVs to improve the environment. To answer these
  questions, this study systematically reviews relevant literature from the past
  decade, focusing on the air environment and traffic operation. We also pay
  additional attention to the link between environmental impacts and improvement
  methods. The findings reveal that the environmental impact of AVs is
  two-sided, and it is primarily determined by connectivity, penetration rate,
  and traffic demand. When traffic demand is low, integrating AVs into traffic
  can lead to environmental improvements. However, under high traffic demand,
  the ability of AVs to improve the environment depends on their connectivity
  and the scale to form a multi-vehicle cooperation. Both micro-level traffic
  parameters and macro-level traffic scenarios affect the environmental benefits
  of AVs. While micro-parameters can be adjusted by altering the settings of AVs
  to realize positive environmental effects, macro-scenario conditions must be
  adapted by AVs through control and management methods to achieve ecological
  goals. Several representative methods from both vehicle control and traffic
  management perspectives are discussed. Generally, the existing control and
  management methods can be categorized into four phases: individual AV control,
  cooperative control of multiple AVs, facility-based management methods, and
  network-based ecological schemes. Finally, this study outlines five potential
  research directions for the sustainable development of AVs."
