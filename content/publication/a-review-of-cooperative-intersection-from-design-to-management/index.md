abstract: Urban intersections are critical areas where traffic flows converge
  and conflict, significantly influencing traffic safety, economic benefits, and
  energy consumption. Effective management and control of intersections have
  become a central focus in transportation research. With the advancement of
  automation technology, intersection management methods combined with connected
  autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have been rapidly developed. However, a
  comprehensive analysis of these emerging approaches remains lacking, from
  intersection design to management. This paper systematically reviews recent
  research on cooperative intersection management (CIM). Firstly, it explores
  the design of intersections. Secondly, various management objectives and
  evaluation methods are outlined. Thirdly, relevant research on vehicle
  trajectory control at the micro level, intersection management at the meso
  level, and arterial traffic flow regulation and network management at the
  macro level are discussed in detail. Based on this analysis, this paper
  identifies future research themes, emphasizing the need for trade-offs,
  integration, and coordination. Key areas for further study include enhancing
  the alignment between abstract models and real-world applications, balancing
  the performance of control methods with their implementation efficiency, and
  integrating various intersection control strategies to collectively enhance
  traffic efficiency, sustainability, and safety cooperatively.
