abstract: Traffic capacity is an important indicator of traffic supply
  capability. An accurate portrayal of intersection capacity serves as a
  foundation for various intersection management studies, supporting the
  optimization of traffic operational efficiency and resource allocation.
  However, existing research on autonomous intersections primarily estimates
  intersection capacity through simulation experiments, which often suffer from
  low efficiency. Consequently, the challenge lies in developing more convenient
  methods for capacity analysis in such environments. To address this gap, this
  paper proposes analytical models for the traffic capacity of autonomous
  intersections based on queuing theory. Firstly, the analytical model of the
  traffic capacity in the conflict zones is derived. Based on that, the capacity
  model for the autonomous intersection is developed by incorporating vehicle
  interaction modes, varying arrival rates, and distinct turning ratios for each
  approach. Depending on the settings of safety time headways, two models,
  referred to as the specific and uniform cases, are considered. Further, the
  capacity range, queuing length, and queuing time of the two scenarios are
  derived. Finally, the rationality and accuracy of the proposed models are
  verified based on numerical simulations. The results show that the proposed
  models can better estimate the actual operating conditions of autonomous
  intersections. The average errors of the autonomous intersection model in the
  one-lane intersection scenario are less than 2%, with a 22% error reduction
  from the baseline model. Besides, the average errors of the multi-lane
  autonomous intersection model are less than 4%. The average relative and
  absolute errors between the model predictions and simulation results for
  queuing length and queuing time are negligible. The proposed models offer
  valuable insights for intersection design, level of service determination, and
  management control strategy selection.
