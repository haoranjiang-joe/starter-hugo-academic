abstract: Autonomous intersection management has become a state-of-the-art control strategy customized for connected and autonomous vehicles. Combining the advantages of tile-based and conflict point-based approaches, this paper proposes a two-stage optimization method based on a developed intersection modeling approach. The first stage is a timing schedule optimization model, assigning vehicle arrival times at an intersection. Based on the output of the first stage, the second stage is a trajectory optimization model, which gives the eco-driving strategies. Moreover, a rolling optimization with a variable cycle length is adopted to run the method continuously. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the genetic algorithm-based method in terms of computation time, and can reduce vehicle delay and fuel consumption by 89.48% and 46.84%, respectively, under different traffic demands compared to the first-come-first-serve method. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method under asymmetric traffic demand is discussed. Sensitivity analyses suggest that (1) a long cycle length benefits the proposed method within certain limits and (2) a proper deceleration within the intersection can balance traffic delay with fuel consumption. In addition, an additional model with a heuristic rule is compared with the original timing schedule optimization model. It is found that reducing binaries in the first stage can make a tradeoff between the quality of the solution and efficiency, which can be used in conjunction with long cycles.
