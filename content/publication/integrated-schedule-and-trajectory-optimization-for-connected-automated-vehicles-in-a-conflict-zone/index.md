abstract: The large-scale application of connected automated vehicles (CAVs)
  provides new opportunities and challenges for the optimization and management
  of traffic conflict zones. To improve the traffic efficiency of conflict zones
  and reduce the travel delay and fuel consumption of CAVs, this paper presents
  a two-level optimization method of scheduling and trajectory planning for
  CAVs. At the first level, a 0â€“1 mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is
  proposed for vehicles entering scheduling. At the second level, a
  multi-vehicle optimal trajectory control model is developed based on the
  optimal vehicle schedule from the first level. Then, to reduce the complexity
  of solving the multi-vehicle optimal trajectory control model, we transform
  this model into non-linear programming (NLP) based on the infinitesimal
  method. Moreover, a rolling optimization strategy is developed to facilitate
  field application. Numerical simulation experiments of different traffic
  scenarios are conducted, and the results show that the proposed method can
  effectively reduce vehicle delays and fuel consumption, compared with the
  first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. The numerical results show that the vehicle
  delay can be reduced by up to 54% and fuel consumption by up to 34% under
  different traffic demands. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the performance
  of the proposed method is mainly determined by the minimum safety time
  interval of vehicles entering the conflict zone.
