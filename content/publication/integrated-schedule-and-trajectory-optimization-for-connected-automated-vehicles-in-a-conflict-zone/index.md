abstract: The large-scale application of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) provides new opportunities and challenges for the optimization and management of traffic conflict zones. To improve the traffic efficiency of conflict zones and reduce the travel delay and fuel consumption of CAVs, this paper presents a two-level optimization method of scheduling and trajectory planning for CAVs. At the first level, a 0â€“1 mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is proposed for vehicles entering scheduling. At the second level, a multi-vehicle optimal trajectory control model is developed based on the optimal vehicle schedule from the first level. Then, to reduce the complexity of solving the multi-vehicle optimal trajectory control model, we transform this model into non-linear programming (NLP) based on the infinitesimal method. Moreover, a rolling optimization strategy is developed to facilitate field application. Numerical simulation experiments of different traffic scenarios are conducted, and the results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce vehicle delays and fuel consumption, compared with the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. The numerical results show that the vehicle delay can be reduced by up to 54% and fuel consumption by up to 34% under different traffic demands. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the performance of the proposed method is mainly determined by the minimum safety time interval of vehicles entering the conflict zone.
