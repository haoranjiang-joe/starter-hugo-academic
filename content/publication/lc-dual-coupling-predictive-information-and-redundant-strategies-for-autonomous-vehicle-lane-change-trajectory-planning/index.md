abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) face considerable challenges when
  interacting with their environment, especially during lane changes. Enhancing
  decision-making and planning processes with prediction regarding the
  intentions and trajectories of surrounding vehicles can significantly improve
  lane change performance. However, prediction accuracy is limited by both the
  technology used and environmental variability. Utilizing low-confidence
  predictive data can adversely impact the safety and comfort of AV operations.
  This paper proposes a novel dual-model framework for lane change
  decision-making and planning of AVs (LC-Dual), which dialectically uses
  predictive data and provides redundant safety measures in parallel. In Model
  I, the optimal end-state trajectory for lane changes is planned using
  predictive information from the upper layer. In Model II, a redundant lane
  change trajectory is quickly generated based on a spatio-temporal safety
  corridor constructed from real perception data. Ultimately, the selection of
  the lane change model and trajectory is determined by rule-based
  decision-making, factoring in prediction confidence and computational
  efficiency. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the LC-Dual framework
  yields more adaptive trajectories in scenarios with accurate predictions and
  effective switches between lane change models in cases of inaccurate
  predictions. The LC-Dual framework markedly improves safety and efficiency in
  lane change operations, thereby facilitating broader AV adoption.
