abstract: This paper proposes a cell transmission model (CTM)-based traffic
  signal timing model of mixed traffic flow composed of connected automated
  vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Firstly, the CTM of mixed
  traffic flow is derived from considering the influence of the market
  penetration rates (MPRs) of CAVs. Secondly, the dynamic evolution is developed
  to capture the queue accumulation and the congestion dissipation at the
  entrance of the intersection. Then, the optimization model is proposed based
  on the constraints of traffic signals and the relationship of flow
  transmission between adjacent cells. Moreover, the simultaneous perturbation
  stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed
  model. The evolution laws of the density of each entrance with time and space
  are compared under the fixed and the optimized traffic signals. Finally, the
  vehicleâ€™s delay is selected as the evaluation index, and the superiority of
  the optimization model is discussed. The results show that the proposed model
  can effectively reduce the range and dissipation time of traffic congestion.
  The average dissipation efficiency of each entrance is increased by 11.11%.
  Furthermore, the traffic delay gradually decreases with the MPRs of CAVs, and
  the delay of homogeneous CAVs is 14.81% lower than that of homogeneous HDVs
  traffic flow. Therefore, the large-scale application of CAVs can alleviate
  traffic congestion and improve the traffic capacity of the signalized
  intersection.
