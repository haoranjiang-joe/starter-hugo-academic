abstract: Autonomous intersection management (AIM) has been widely investigated
  over the past two decades as a solution for signal-free intersections in a
  fully connected and autonomous environment. However, existing AIM approaches
  lack consideration for crossing pedestrians, especially in a way that enables
  pedestrians to cross streets safely while optimizing upcoming vehicles at the
  intersection to maintain traffic continuity. To address this issue, this paper
  proposes an Automated Pedestrian Shuttle (APS) service system to transport
  pedestrians across the street. Using a coupled spaceâ€“time network modeling
  method, an optimization model, which incorporates pedestrian ride strategies
  and aims to minimize the total crossing time, is first established for the APS
  operation scheme. A Shuttle-by-Shuttle-Planning (SBSP) algorithm is developed
  for model solving to determine the APS operation route and the departure time
  from each station along the route. Then, a timing schedule optimization model
  is proposed to adjust the departure time of APS at each station and the time
  of main-lane vehicles entering an intersection to avoid vehicle conflicts. To
  ensure that the main-lane vehicles can enter the intersection on time, a
  trajectory optimization model is proposed to provide a specific driving
  strategy for each main-lane vehicle. A rolling horizon strategy is adopted to
  bridge the different optimization time windows. Finally, the effectiveness of
  the proposed APS service system is demonstrated through numerical simulation
  experiments. The results show that (1) the APS service can effectively help
  pedestrians cross the street with minor delays to main-lane vehicles; (2) The
  dynamic-route scheme is adaptable to the needs of randomly arriving
  pedestrians due to its demand-responsive nature; (3) The service efficiency of
  the system is related to the number of APSs, and the more APSs, the higher the
  service efficiency under the premise of unsaturation; (4) The designed SBSP
  algorithm significantly reduces the model-solving time compared to the
  commercial solver, making the APS service system potentially applicable for
  field implementation.
